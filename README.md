# randomProxy
Fetches a list of proxies from a [online service](https://geonode.com/free-proxy-list/) and allows you to fetch one at random matching a certain usability criteria.

The code is hopefully straight forward enough to just be able to use it without having to read the docs. It should be documented well enough.

Feel free to add changes etc.
